vim-syncr (modified by P. Kubiczek)
=========

My modification regards fixing the local and remote paths such that upload/download process is easier. Following description comes from https://github.com/s10g/vim-syncr and by no means do I claim any level of authorship. 

***

vim-syncr is a simple vim script for uploading/downloading files to a remote location or deleting files from a remote location using rsync over ssh.

I needed to solve this workflow and its criterias:
1. Local git repository with typical web files (html, php, images, etc)
2. Remote web root
3. Mirror my local environment to the remote web root minus files/directories marked for exclusion (yes "web files", no git folder)

Criterias:
- Must be able to "clean up" remotely by deleting or renaming files that I delete or rename locally
- Authorization and authentication must "Just work" with SSH keys; I want no hassle, no password prompts

I found [vim-hsftp](https://github.com/hesselbom/vim-hsftp) but I couldn't quite get it to work. It did however have excellent configuration loading code, so [vim-syncr](https://github.com/s10g/vim-syncr) is forked from [vim-hsftp](https://github.com/hesselbom/vim-hsftp). All credit goes to hesselbom/vim-hsftp; without it this project would never have been started.
